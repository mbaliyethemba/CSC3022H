Assignment 3

Files: 
	HuffmanNode: This class represents the nodes of the huffman tree. Has left and right pointers for children.
		
	HuffmanTree: This class represents the huffman tree. It has a create method that filles up a priority queue and then builds a huffman tree. The tree is then traversed using traverse method which works out bit string for each character.
	   	     The compression method creates 2 files, first file is a code table for each character and the second file is a binary version of the input file based on the code table. 
	
	driver: This reads the input table, maps character frequencies, creates a huffmantree and calls the createTree and compress methods.

Instructions: 
1. Type 'make' in terminal
2. Type 'huffencode <inputFile><output file>' where inputFile is an input English (ASCII) text file and output file, is the names of your output compressed bitstream.
3. When finished type 'make clean' to clean binary files.
4.Run make tests to build the executable, test in the build/Tests directory.
5.Run make run-tests to run the test executable.
